   What is sharepoint??
   <br/>
  </h4>
  <p>
   For Office 365 Sharepoint is just as easy. The Office365 class grabs a login token from MicrosoftÃ¢ÂÂs login servers then It logins the Sharepoint site and uses the cookie for Authentication. Make sure to put just the root url for the site in Office365 and add
   <a data-cke-saved-href='\"Https://\"'>
    Https://
   </a>
   at start.
